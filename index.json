Inspired by the findings reported in the original paper, we attempt to recreate the results by building the same circuit. All the devices are implemented using TSMC 65 nm PDK components.\nBefore diving into circuit details, it should be emphasized that we use Verilog-A VCO model and tune its parameters to suit our needs:\nParameter Value VCO gain 90 MHz/V VCO bank gap 20 MHz VCO frequency 2.6 GHz FLL division 24 Sub-sampling Phase Detector and Loop Filter Fig. 1 depicts our SS PD circuit diagram. Note that this circuits acts both as SS PD and Loop Filter (LF) because two transistors and a capacitor can effectively be seen as a series resistance R1, which is defined by: $$ R_1 = \\frac{1}{f_{ref}*C_1} $$ Another important observation is that contrary to what is proposed in the reference paper, we omitted the stabilizing zero path since phase margin is not of concern due to the presence of Verilog-A Voltage- Controlled Oscillator (VCO). We also do not place any dummy transistors as charge sharing effect is not captured in the simulation. Thus, we have two transistor whose $\\frac{W}{L} = \\frac{2000}{60}$. We keep the resistor R2 value to be the same as in the original paper (20kΩ), however, C1 and C2 should be carefully selected. The reason has to do with the fact that this SS PD can be viewed as an RC circuit with BW of: $$ BW_{PD+LF} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi(R_1+R_2)C_2}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi(\\frac{C_2}{f_{ref}C_1}+R_2C_2)} $$ which attenuates the incoming signal proportional to $\\frac{C_2}{C_1}$. Therefore, one has to increase $C_1$ while keeping $C_2$ at minimum. However, this comes at a cost of the area and clock feedthrough, which could be filtered out by using larger $C_2$. Having this intuition, we decided to set $C_2 = 20 fF$ and $C_1 = 200 fF$, which adequately suppresses clock feedthrough while keeping the control voltage between $\\sim\\pm200 mV$.\nSS PD and LF schematics. PLL schematic with transistor-level SS-PD + LF and Verilog-A MUXes, FLL, and VCO. Synthesized Frequency-Locked Loop Another important block in the proposed SS PLL is FLL. Our FLL is implemented digitally using Verilog. The code is provided in the Appendix section. To develop the code we started with the FSM diagram demonstrated in Fig. 3, which is a simplified version of the original FSM, where the authors have an extra state for power savings. In contrast, our code, regardless of the outcome of State 3 (i.e. PLL_EN = 1/0), returns to State 2 and starts counting again. When the reset is enabled, the capacitor bank is initialized to a 32-bit word that sets VCO to 2.4 GHz. There are two always blocks in the Verilog code, one for counting the VCO cycles and another for state transition and output logic. The latter is synchronized to the reference clock to minimize random jitter effects on the FLL output. Afterwards, the code is sourced into Cadence Genus for Register Transfer Level (RTL) synthesis. The result is shown in Fig. 4.\nThe division ratio is supplied as an 8-bit input to FLL, which then outputs 32-bit capacitor bank code word and sets CAL_READY (PLL_EN in the Verilog code) node to 1 or 0 in Fig. 2. This signal, in its turn, connects Vcontrol to SS PD and if disconnected, sets it to 0V differential using an inverter and a pair of NMOS transistors (all min. width). It should be mentioned that the ADC and DAC in Fig. 2 are behavioural models that are used to facilitate visualization of digital bus signals.\nFSM for FLL. FLL schematic. System-level Simulations Once all the blocks are designed and tuned for target specifications, the PLL is simulated for various scenarios including target frequency change, phase step in reference clock, and noise analysis. Fig. 5 illustrates the behaviour of the PLL for various target frequencies. It can be deduced that the proposed PLL successfully locks for all conditions with a good settling time. Although we designed our FLL and configured VCO in such a way as to have 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 GHz frequencies at the middle of the tuning curves, which ideally correspond to $V_{control}$ = 0V , there are cases when FLL lets PLL to takeover the control one frequency step before its expected value. Consequently, in order to lock PLL increases $V_{control}$ up to 200 mV to compensate for this small error in FLL. This is only observed when moving down the tuning curves, regardless of the target frequency. When moving up the curves, the FLL behaves as expected, therefore PLL keeps $V_{control}$ at around 0V. This problem was further investigated by visualizing the nodes inside FLL and it seems that the issue originates from the irregularities in the phase of VCO. As a consequence, the FLL counts 1 less VCO cycle and thinks that it is at the correct frequency.

Our first results demonstrated that while the generated images are better than the classically interpolated versions, it still lacks a lot of features such as colors and facial features. Therefore, we began training another model which includes simple data augmentation techniques and longer warm up phase. After merely 20 epochs, one can already see the major benefits of these changes. Thus, our latest model achieved over 35 dB average PSNR on the test set and we visually demonstrated that it indeed produces better images.

Though the mechanical movement causes the relays to be inherently slower than transistors, the metallic contact interface untethers the limitation on gate-to-drain voltage, which makes the relays capable of handling higher voltages. In this work, we propose novel designs for BEOL NEM relay-based inductorless DC-DC converters for on-chip voltage conversions. The design, implementation, and analysis of buck (step-down) and boost (step-up) converters are shown. Both converters consist of only four NEM relays, respectively. By utilizing the charge pump topology in a switched-capacitor configuration, the relay converters exhibit lower output ripple and higher efficiency compared to their CMOS counterparts. This is particularly valuable for DC-DC voltage conversions in the Internet of Things chips, where the converter switching frequency is moderate, while the demands for efficiency, area saving, and on-chip integration are high.","tags":[],"title":"BEOL NEM Relay-Based Inductorless DC-DC Converters","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this work, we formulated and solved the energy optimization problem of optimal sensor-to-sink binding in WSNs.

Further works can be done to improve all three numbers by training on a larger dataset as well as by transferring weights from a model specifically pre-trained to recognize human faces.\n","date":1575936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575936000,"objectID":"12b06cca5cac72f45bde6a5b0495b172","permalink":"https://dazhigulov.github.io/project/utkface/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/utkface/","section":"project","summary":"Apparent Age, Gender and Ethnicity Prediction using Deep Learning techniques","tags":["Machine Learning","Programming"],"title":"Apparent Age, Gender and Ethnicity Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Deployed a real-time face recognition system on Raspberry Pi 3 for automated attendance monitoring.

Both of them were theoretically analyzed with proper explanations and the expectations were stated as well. In order to verify the theory, the circuits were simulated to obtain their frequency response, transfer function, and to study the effect of common mode bias on the output voltage. Thus, by contrasting between simple differential amplifier and its cascoded version, one can deduce that there are clear tradeoffs when choosing among them. While the former has greater 3-dB frequency and more voltage legroom, it is inferior to the cascoded version of differential amplifer in terms of other parameters. The latter as seen from the simulations provided superior DM gain while lowering the CM-DM gain. Hence it is reasonable to suggest that the choice should be given to the one which best fits the application.\n","date":1554854400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554854400,"objectID":"ed7eac2f4949db2ac2028028be2ef093","permalink":"https://dazhigulov.github.io/project/ldo/","publishdate":"2019-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ldo/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis of the role of Error Amplifier in the context of Low-Dropout Voltage Regulators.","tags":["Circuit Design"],"title":"Error Amplifier in LDO","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
